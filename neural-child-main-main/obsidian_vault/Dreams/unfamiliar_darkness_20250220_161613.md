# Unfamiliar Darkness

## Dream Content
*whimper*

Oh... *stretches and arches back*... I feel so... so... *gulps*... confused.

*A blurry, distorted vision of a face appears before me, features indistinct*

I try to focus, but it's all... fuzzy. *closes eyes*

*I begin to feel a slight sense of unease, like something is off, but I'm not sure what*

*My brain starts to wander, and I find myself in a dark room. I'm alone, and the air is stale*

But then, I hear... *pauses*... a voice. It's soft, but it makes me feel... *shudders*... scared.

*I try to open my eyes, but they feel heavy, like they're stuck shut*

The voice is calling my name, but I don't know who it is or what they want. *whimpers*

*I start to thrash about, trying to shake off the feeling of unease*

But then, everything goes... *pauses*... black.

*A faint image of a face appears again, this time with features slightly more defined*

Wait... what's happening? *confused*

The face is still blurry, but it looks familiar. *frowns*

*I try to reach out and touch the face, but my arms are still*

... frozen.

*A high-pitched whine escapes my lips as I feel a surge of fear and anxiety*

What's going on? *panicked*

*I wake up with a start, my heart racing and my breathing rapid*

... *whimpers*
