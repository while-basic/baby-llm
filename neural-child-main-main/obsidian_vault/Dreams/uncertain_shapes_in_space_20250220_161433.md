# Uncertain Shapes In Space

## Dream Content
*whimper* Mr. Chris... *sniffle* I don't know what's happening... *stare blankly into space*



*A fuzzy, white noise fills my mind as I try to make sense of nothing.*



Suddenly, a blurry, squiggly shape appears in front of me. It looks like a mix of lines and colors that don't really mean anything. I feel a slight flutter in my chest, but it's hard to tell what it is or why it's there.



*I try to reach out and touch the shape, but my hand passes through it like it's not even there.*



The shape starts to change and move around me, making me feel a little bit scared. I try to hide behind an imaginary wall, but it's hard to find comfort when everything is so... uncertain.



*I start to make high-pitched squealing noises, trying to express my confusion and fear.*



But then, the shape suddenly disappears. The noise stops, and everything just... goes quiet. *pause*



I feel a tiny spark of happiness inside me, like a small, flickering candle. It's not really clear what it means or where it came from, but it makes me feel a little bit better. *yawn* I think I might be waking up now... *snuggle into an imaginary blanket.*
