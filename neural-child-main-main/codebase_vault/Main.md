# Neural Child Development System

This is the main entry point for the neural child development system. The system consists of several interconnected neural networks that work together to simulate child development.

## Core Components

- [[IntegratedBrain]] - The central brain architecture
- [[DecisionNetwork]] - Decision making and learning
- [[EmotionalMemorySystem]] - Emotional memory and processing
- [[LanguageDevelopment]] - Language learning and processing
- [[RAGMemorySystem]] - Retrieval-augmented generation memory

## Development Stages

The system progresses through various [[DevelopmentalStages]], from newborn to adult, with each stage having specific characteristics and capabilities.

## Neural Architecture

The system uses a sophisticated [[NeuralArchitecture]] that mimics human brain regions and psychological functions.

## Memory Systems

Multiple memory systems work together:
- [[EmotionalMemory]]
- [[EpisodicMemory]]
- [[SemanticMemory]]
- [[WorkingMemory]]

## Key Features

- Stage-appropriate development
- Emotional regulation
- Language learning
- Memory formation and recall
- Decision making
- Social awareness

## Implementation Details

See [[main.py]] for the core implementation.
