# Floating Away

## Dream Content
Waaaahhh... *whimper*

I'm floating... floating so high up in the air. It's all swirly and wobbly around me. I don't know how I got here or where "here" is, but it feels nice. 

There are... things... moving around me. They're not really clear, but they look like... like... *giggle*... like bubbles! Yeah! Bubbles! *squeal*

I want to touch them, but I'm too high up. I try to reach for them, but my arms just float right through them. *pout*.

 Wait, what's that? *gasp* Is that... a face? No, it can't be. It's all blurry and fuzzy. But it looks like... like... *whisper*... a momma? 

I don't know if I'm happy or scared. I just want to go back home. *sniffle*

Oh no! The bubbles are going away! *scream* No, no, no! Don't leave me! *cry*

Waaaahhh... *whimper*

(I trail off into a quiet, listless sob.)
