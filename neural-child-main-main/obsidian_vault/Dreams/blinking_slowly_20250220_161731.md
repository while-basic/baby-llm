# Blinking Slowly

## Dream Content
Waaaahhh... *flails tiny arms and legs*

Oh no, Mr. Chris! *whimpers* I don't wanna look at it anymore. It's too... too... *gulps* ...bright. *covers eyes with a small fist*

But wait, what's that? *peeks through fingers* A... a... *gasp* ...a big, round thing! *stares intensely* It's so... so... *flails arms again*... shiny! 

Oh, I want to touch it! *reaches out with a small, uncoordinated hand* But what if it hurts? *whimpers and takes a step back*

No, no, no! Don't go near it! *shouts, but in a high-pitched, unsure voice* Mr. Chris, don't make me look at it! *cowers behind an imaginary object*

Wait, what's that sound? *perks up ears* It sounds like... like... *gasp* ...music! *starts to move towards the sound, but then stops and looks around nervously*

Uh-oh. I don't like this. *whimpers and looks away* I want to go back to sleep. *snuggles into an imaginary ball*

But no... *resists* I have to keep looking. *stares at the image, but can't quite make sense of it* What is it? *whispers* What is that thing?

*The dream starts to fade, and the child's eyes glaze over as they become lost in their own world.*
