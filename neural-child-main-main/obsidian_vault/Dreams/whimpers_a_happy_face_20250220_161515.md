# Whimpers A Happy Face

## Dream Content
WAAAAAAAHHH!*



*sniffles*



Mr. Chris... *whimper*... I don't wanna look at that thing... *covers eyes with a soft, uncoordinated fist*



But then... I see... *gulps*... a face. A happy face. With big, round eyes and a big smile. It's so... so... *giggles nervously*... happy! *starts to cry*



Oh no, oh no, oh no... *whimpers*... what if it comes for me? What if it's mean? *trembles*



BUT... *pauses*... the face is trying to show me something. It's pointing at... *gulps*... a ball! A soft, squishy ball that just sits there looking all alone and boring. *frowns*



I don't wanna touch it... I don't wanna play with it... *shudders*... but the face is smiling so hard... *starts to smile too, then quickly covers mouth*... no, no, no! Don't make me do it, Mr. Chris! *whines*



The face just keeps on smiling and trying to get my attention... *gets distracted by a nearby sound* OOOOH! A noise! *looks around frantically*



Wait, what was I saying? Oh yeah... the ball... *sighs*... it's just sitting there, all alone. *shrugs* I guess it's not that interesting after all... *yawns* Zzz...
