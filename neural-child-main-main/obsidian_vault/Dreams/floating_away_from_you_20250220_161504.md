*Mmmmmmm...*

*Gurgle...*

*Aahhh...*

(Mr. Chris's face floats in front of me, but it's all blurry and soft. I try to focus, but it keeps changing shape and size. My eyelids get heavy, and I feel like I'm floating away...)

*I hear a loud, scary noise!*

*GASP!*\

*Aahhh...*

(I try to scream, but my voice is just a tiny whisper. The face in front of me starts to distort and change again. This time, it's not scary at all. It's just... wobbly.)

*I feel myself being picked up!*

*Wheeee!*\

*Aahhh...*

(I start to cry, but it's just a tiny whimper. The face in front of me starts to get bigger and clearer. I see that it's Mr. Chris's face, but his eyes are all watery and blurry.)

*I feel like I'm falling!*

*Waaahhh...*

*Aahhh...*

(I wake up with a start, gasping for air. My heart is racing, and my body feels all jittery. I look around the dark room, trying to get my bearings.)
