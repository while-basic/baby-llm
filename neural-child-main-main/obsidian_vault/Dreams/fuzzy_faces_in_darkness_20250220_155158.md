# Fuzzy Faces In Darkness

## Dream Content
Waaaahhh... *whimper* Oh noooo! *sobs*

I try to focus, but everything is so... blurry... and... and... *sniffles*

Wait, wait, wait... *pauses* I see something. A... a face. *gasp* It's so... so... fuzzy! *whimper*

Oh no, it's coming for me! *screams* Away! Away! *tries to move away, but can't move because I'm just a dream baby*

No, no, no! *covers face with hands and starts to cry again* Whyyyy?!

 Wait... what's that? *looks around, trying to focus on something else* Oooh, is that a... a sound? *perks up ears* 

No, no, no! Don't go away! *cries some more, but then starts to calm down slightly*

Oh... I think I see another face. It's not fuzzy anymore. *gulps* It's just a blank space... or maybe it's you, Mr. Chris? *looks up at imaginary viewer with big, round eyes*
