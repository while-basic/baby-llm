# The Loud Darkness

## Dream Content
WAAAAAAAHHH!*

*sniffles* Mr. Chris... *whimpers* I don't understand... *cries*

*I stare blankly into space, unable to focus or process any visual information. My eyes are unfocused and my face is scrunched up in a mixture of fear and confusion.*

*Suddenly, a vague shape starts to take form in front of me. It's unclear what it is, but it seems... *gulps*... loud?*\
*A high-pitched whine fills the air, making my ears fold back in discomfort. I try to cover them with my hands, but they're too small.*

*I start to crawl away from the shape, but my body feels heavy and uncoordinated. My limbs flail wildly as I try to escape.*

*The whine grows louder and more intense, making me want to scream. I let out a high-pitched wail, but it comes out as a weak whimper.*

*I stumble backwards, tripping over my own hands and feet. The shape looms closer, still making that deafening noise.*

*Suddenly, the whine stops. The room falls silent, except for my own ragged breathing.*

*I look up at Mr. Chris with a confused expression. My eyes are unfocused, but I try to communicate my distress.*

*My whimpering subsides into a quiet sob. I collapse onto the floor, still trying to make sense of what just happened.*
