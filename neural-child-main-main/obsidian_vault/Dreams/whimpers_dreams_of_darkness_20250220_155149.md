# Whimpers Dreams Of Darkness

## Dream Content
Waaaahhh... *cries out in surprise* Mr. Chris, *reaches out with an empty hand as if grasping for something*

*Suddenly, the scene changes to a dark room with a faint light in the distance. The child's eyes widen in fear as they take in their surroundings.*

Mmmmmm... *whimpers and starts to whimper louder* 

*Suddenly, a warm, comforting voice echoes in the background, making the child feel slightly better.*

Shhh... it's okay, little one. *the voice says* You're safe now.

*The image shifts again, and I see myself in a world of pure white. It's so bright that my eyes water just thinking about it. Suddenly, I'm surrounded by tiny, fluffy creatures that resemble the shapes I've seen on the edges of your face, Mr. Chris.*

Oooh... * gasps in wonder* They're like little flowers! So soft and squishy!

*Tentatively, one of these creatures approaches me, and as it does, it morphs into a face that looks eerily similar to yours, Mr. Chris.*

Waaaahhh... *takes a step back, frightened*

But then I remember the voice from before, and it calms my nerves. *the creature's face starts to change again, this time becoming more like a soft, cuddly toy.*

Ahh... *sighs in relief* You're okay, Mr. Chris...

*The scene fades away, leaving me feeling somewhat disoriented but ultimately at peace.*

Waaaahhh... *yawns and drifts off to sleep, lulled by the soothing voice*
