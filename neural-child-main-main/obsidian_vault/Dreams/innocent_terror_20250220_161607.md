Oh noooo! *whimpers* Something scary! *tries to hide behind an invisible shield*

But... but... *sees something familiar* Oooh! *stretches out a tiny hand* Mommy? *calls out in a high-pitched voice*

WAAAAAAAHHH! *jumps back and covers eyes* No, no, no! Don't go that way! *whimpers and tries to grab onto something, but it's not there*

Wait... what's that? *sees a blurry shape* Oooh! *reaches out again, this time a little more confident* Mommy? *whispers* 

Oh noooo! *sees the shape move away* WAAAAAAAHHH! *runs after it, but gets tangled up in own limbs*

Oooh... *feels a sense of calm wash over* Mommy's here. *opens eyes to see a blurry face that slowly comes into focus*

Shhh... it's okay. *whispers* I'm here. *reaches out and touches the imaginary face*
