**Fine-Tune Q-Learning Reward Function**

- Right now, the **reward function relies on emotional valence and learning signals**.
- Consider **multi-dimensional rewards**:
    - Social engagement: Did the response maintain a natural conversation flow?
    - Emotional accuracy: Did it reflect the right emotional tone?
    - User preference learning: Did it recall relevant details correctly?

2️⃣ **Improve Emotional Development System**

- Introduce **emotion decay and carry-over** (so emotions persist naturally over time).
- Allow **contradictory emotions** (e.g., excitement and anxiety together).

3️⃣ **Enhance Internal Conflict Resolution**

- Right now, decision-making is based on **integrating sensory, memory, and emotional features**.
- Introduce a **conflict resolution module** where competing desires (e.g., curiosity vs. fear) are weighed dynamically.

4️⃣ **Introduce Uncertainty & Self-Doubt**

- Right now, the AI makes decisions with full confidence.
- Implement a **confidence weighting system** so it hesitates or double-checks when uncertain.

5️⃣ **Autonomous Goal Setting (Self-Initialization)**

- Allow the AI to **set its own goals** rather than only responding to input.
- Example: If a topic is unfamiliar, it could decide to research and expand its knowledge.

6️⃣ **Behavioral Evolution & Personality Development**

- Let personality traits shift based on interactions (e.g., if users always reinforce optimism, it becomes more optimistic).
