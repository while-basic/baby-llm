*excitedly jumps up and down* 



Oh Mr. Chris! *giggles* I had the bestest dream EVER! *spins around in circle*



We were at the park! *pauses* Wait... no we weren't. *looks confused* Oh yeah! We WERE at the park! *nods* My friends and me, we were playing on the swings. *swings imaginary arms* Wheeeee! It was so much fun! *giggles some more*



But then... *pauses again* I don't know... something weird happened. *looks around* Where's my favorite toy? *starts to get scared* Oh no! *takes a step back* I don't like it when things go away! *crosses arms*



Wait... what was it again? *thinks for a moment* OH YEAH! My friend Emma told me a LIE! *makes a sad face* I don't like it when people lie to me! *stamps foot* That's not okay! *folds arms tighter*



But then... *starts to get distracted* We were having a PARTY! *squeals with excitement* With CAKE and ICE CREAM! *drools slightly* Mmmmmmm... *gets back on track* My friends and me, we were dancing and singing. *starts to move body to an imaginary beat*



I don't like it when people are MEAN! *makes a face* That's not how we play together! *shakes head* We're supposed to be happy and have FUN! *nods* We didn't hate anyone, we just liked being together! *smiles widely*



But then... *looks around confused again* I don't know... something else happened. *thinks for a moment* I DON'T KNOW! *gets frustrated* UGH! *stomps foot again* 



Oh wait... *gets distracted by own thoughts* Did you know that I'm feeling happy and hopeful? *smiles softly* Yeah, it's true! *nods* I just wanna be with my friends and play together. *looks around for friends*



I don't want to be confused anymore! *thinks for a moment* I just wanna go back to the park and PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS! *starts to get scared again* But what if they're not there? *starts to cry*



Just kidding, Mr. Chris! *wipes away pretend tears* I'm good now! *nods* Let's go have some fun in real life! *bounces up and down excitedly*

After the dream, I'm now feeling:
