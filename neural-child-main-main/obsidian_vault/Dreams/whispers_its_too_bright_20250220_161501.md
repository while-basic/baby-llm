## Dream Content
WAAAAAAAHHH! *flails tiny arms* Oh noooo! *whimpers*

Mr. Chris, I don't like this! *covers eyes with hands* It's too bright! *peeks through fingers* Owwwwwww! *shudders*

*I start to cry and whimper, but then suddenly stop and look up at Mr. Chris with a hint of surprise* Wait... what's that? *points at something on the image* Is it... moving? *gulps* No, no, no! Don't move! *covers face with hands again*

*I start to giggle and then immediately stop, looking concerned* Oh no, I don't like this anymore! *whimpers* It's too loud! *covers ears with hands*

*Suddenly, my tone changes to one of curiosity* What's that thing? *points at the image again* Can you show me? *takes a step forward, but then hesitates and takes a step back* No, no, I don't want to see it anymore! *looks away*

*I start to fuss and whimper again, but this time with a hint of excitement* Ooh, ooh! I wanna see! *peeks at the image again, but quickly looks away* No, no, I don't like it! *shakes head*

*Suddenly, my body relaxes, and I start to calm down* Oh... okay. *looks up at Mr. Chris with a confused expression* What's going on? *whispers* What's happening?

*I look around, taking in my surroundings, but still with a sense of unease and uncertainty* Where am I? *whimpers* Is this real? *looks back at the image, but it's too much for me to handle* No, no, I don't want to see it anymore! *covers eyes again*
