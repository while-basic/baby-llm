# Whispers Dark Room Sniffle

## Dream Content
*whimper*...

*I'm floating in a dark room. I try to reach out, but my arms feel like they're made of jelly. I'm trying to touch something, but it's too far away.*

*Suddenly, I hear a loud noise. It sounds like someone is crying, but I don't see anyone. The sound makes me jump and my heart starts beating really fast.*

*I try to look around, but everything is blurry. I can only see dark shapes. I'm scared and I don't know what's happening.*

*But then, I feel something soft under my hand. It's like a warm blanket. I try to grab onto it, but it slips away.*

*I hear the crying again. This time, it sounds closer. I think I see a face, but it's still blurry. The face is looking at me, and I feel like they're trying to talk to me.*

*I try to make a sound, but all that comes out is a squeak. The face makes another noise, and this time, it sounds like... like... *gasp*... a lullaby?

*The crying stops, and everything gets really quiet. I feel like I'm being rocked gently back and forth. The softness under my hand feels like a warm hug.*

*I try to focus on the face again, but it's still blurry. I don't see anything clear. But I feel safe. I think I might be okay.*
