# Floating In The Dark

## Dream Content
*Mumbling and whimpering*

Oh... *flails arms and legs*

*I'm floating, suspended in mid-air. The world around me is dark, but I can sense... something.*

*A faint, blurry shape begins to take form before me. It's like... a... a... *gasp* ...a dot? No, wait, it's not a dot. It's... it's... a thing.*

*I try to reach out and touch the thing, but my hands pass right through it. I feel... strange.*

*Suddenly, the world around me starts to distort and ripple. Colors begin to seep into view, but they're all wrong. They're like... swirly patterns that make my head hurt.*

*I try to move away from the thing, but it's pulling me in. I can feel its... presence? No, wait, it's not a presence. It's... it's... *shudder* ...a feeling.*

*Suddenly, everything goes white. I'm back in my own skin, gasping for air. *Wheezing*

*I wake up with a start, my heart racing. What just happened?*
