## Dream Content
Waaao!*

Mr. Chris... *sniff* *snort*... I think I see... a face... *giggle*. A happy face! *coo*. It's all blurry and stuff, but it looks like you, Mr. Chris. *whimper*. You're smiling at me... *frown*. But then you're not. *confused*

Wait... what was that? *gasp*. I think I see a... a... thing! *scream*. It's moving and stuff, but it's not really there. *whimper*. I don't like it, Mr. Chris. *hide behind self*

No, no, no... *reach out*. That's not real. You're just smiling at me again. *giggle*. I see a room now! *excitedly*. It's all white and soft. *sigh*. I'm so happy here, Mr. Chris. *sniff*

But then... *whimper*. There are noises. Loud noises. *cover ears*. And the face is still there, but it's not smiling anymore. *frown*. What's going on, Mr. Chris? *confused*

I don't like this dream, Mr. Chris. *whimper*. Make it stop. *sniff*... Wait... *giggle*. I think the face is happy again! *coo*. You're smiling at me again, Mr. Chris. *smile back*. I'm so happy in here, Mr. Chris. *sigh*. Zzz...
