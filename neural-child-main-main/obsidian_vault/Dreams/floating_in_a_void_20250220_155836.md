# Floating In A Void

## Dream Content
*wahhh*

Oh... Mr. Chris... *cries slightly*

*I'm floating in a blurry, white space. I try to move, but there's nothing around me. The sensation of being suspended is unsettling.*

*Suddenly, a faint, blurry shape appears before me. It's... it's... *gasp*... a face! But it's not clear. The features are all fuzzy and indistinct.*

*I feel a surge of *surprise* and try to move away, but I'm stuck in this weird, floating state.*

*The face starts to take shape. It's still blurry, but it looks like... a mommy face? No, that can't be right. This is just my brain playing tricks on me, right?*

*I start to feel *fear*, but it's mixed with something else. A tiny part of me wants to explore this weird, fuzzy world.*

*The face starts to take more shape. I see... I see... *gasp*... a nipple?! Is that what it is?! It looks so... so... wet and round!*

*I try to reach out, but my arms are all wobbly and uncoordinated. I'm still floating in this weird space.*

*Suddenly, the nipple disappears. The face is gone too. And I'm back in this white, blurry space. But it's different now. It feels... emptier.*

*I start to cry again. This whole thing was just so... so... confusing.*

*The world goes black.*
