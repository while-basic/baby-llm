## Dream Content
WAAAAAAAHHH! *flails limbs wildly*

Oh no, oh no, oh no... *whimpers* What's happening? Where am I? *looks around frantically*

I'm... I'm in a dark room. It's so... so... *shudders* scary. There are... things... moving around. *tries to move away, but can't move because of some invisible force*

Wait, what's that? *sees something out of the corner of my vision, but it's just a shadow or a reflection* Oh no, it's coming for me! *screams and tries to cover eyes*

But... but... *remembers something, and a look of excitement spreads across face* I remember playing with blocks! *excitedly starts babbling on about blocks and building things*

No, no, no! Get away from me! *tries to run, but still can't move*

Wait... what's that sound? *perks up ears, trying to listen more closely* It sounds like... music. *starts to whimper again, but then starts to hum a faint melody*

I... I think I'm safe now. *looks around cautiously, then relaxes and starts to doze off* Zzz... blocks... zzz... *starts to make gentle block-building sounds with mouth*
