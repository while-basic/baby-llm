# Fragile Touch

## Dream Content
Wahhh... *cries slightly*

I'm seeing... nothing. A blank space. No colors, no shapes. Just a void. *sniffles*

But then... I feel a gentle touch. Soft and warm. Like the warmth of a mother's skin. *looks around frantically, but sees nothing*

Oh no... what if it's not real? What if I'm just dreaming? *starts to whimper*

Wait... I see something. A face. Soft and blurry. *stares intensely at the non-existent image*

It's a face... with eyes... that look like... the warmth of the touch. *gets confused and scared*

No, no, no! Don't go away! *reaches out with an imaginary hand to grasp something, but finds only air*

Oh no... I'm all alone again. *starts to cry softly*

The face... it's smiling at me. *looks around wildly, trying to find the source of the smile, but there's nothing*

I want to hold you... *reaches out with an imaginary hand, hoping against hope that someone will grasp back*

But... you're not here. *sobs quietly*

And then... everything fades away. *falls asleep, still whimpering softly*
