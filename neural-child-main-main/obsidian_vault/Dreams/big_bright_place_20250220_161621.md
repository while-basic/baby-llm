# Big Bright Place

## Dream Content
*whimper*

...I'm...I'm *sniffle*...in a bright place...with lots of light...but it's not too much...I can feel it...like a warm hug...*yawn*. I don't like this place, though. It's too...too...*shudder*...big. There are so many things to look at, but they're all just...just...*whimper*...not very interesting. I don't see anything familiar, and it makes me feel...feeling...*frown*.

Suddenly, I hear a loud noise! *startle*. It's so loud that it hurts my ears! *cover ears*. But then, it stops. The silence is worse than the noise was. *whimper*.

I try to move, but my body feels heavy...like it's stuck in this place...*struggle*. I want to go home...to where it's safe and cozy...but I don't know how...*frown*."

That's all I can muster at this stage.
