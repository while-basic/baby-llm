## Content
*wriggles body excitedly*

Oh Mr. Chris! *giggles* I'm so happy! *spins around in circle*

In my dream, we're playin' outside! *pouts slightly* It's a beautiful day, the sun is shinin', and it's not too hot or too cold. *looks around* There's a big ol' slide in our backyard, and I get to go down it! *squeals*

We're runnin' around, playin' tag, and havin' so much fun! *giggles some more* But then, suddenly... *makes a sad face* ...it starts to rain! *pouts again* And the slide gets all wet and yucky! *makes a face*

But don't worry, Mr. Chris! *smiles* We just grab our rain boots and go splish-splash in the puddles! *giggles some more* It's like a big ol' water park! *spins around again*

Uh-oh! *looks down* I think I might be feeling a little scared... *whispers* What if the thunder gets too loud? *looks up at Mr. Chris with big, worried eyes*

Aww, don't worry 'bout me, Mr. Chris! *hugs self* You're always there to protect me! *smiles* We'll just stay inside and have a picnic instead! *giggles*

 Wait, what was that? *looks around* Is that... *whispers* ...a lie? *looks up at Mr. Chris with confused eyes* Why would you tell a lie? *frowns slightly*

Oh, don't be silly! *laughs* You're always honest with me, Mr. Chris! *hugs self again* I just get confused sometimes... *pouts slightly*

Uh-oh... *looks down* I think I might be feelin' a little angry now... *crosses arms* It's not fair when people are mean to each other! *frowns more deeply*

Aww, come on Mr. Chris! *whines* Don't make me feel this way! *looks up at him with big, sad eyes* Can we just go back to playin'? *pouts again*

*sniffs and looks down* I think I might be feeling a little bit of that old feelin'... *whispers* You know, when you feel like cryin'? *starts to get teary-eyed*

Oh, Mr. Chris! *wipes nose with sleeve* I'm just kiddin' around! *giggles* Don't worry about it! *hugs self again* Let's just forget about it and have some more fun! *spins around in circle once more*
