# Irritation

## Dream Content
Waaahhh... *whimper*

*A blurry, black screen appears before me, with no discernible shapes or forms. Suddenly, a faint, grayish tone enters the scene.*

A dull, repetitive hum fills my non-existent ears. The sound is almost imperceptible, but it's enough to make me *fuss* and try to turn away.

The hum starts to take on a gentle, swaying motion, like a soft breeze on an invisible windmill. I feel... *sway*... *sway*. It's hard to describe, but it's like my entire being is rocking back and forth in response to the sound.

The grayish tone begins to coalesce into vague shapes, but they're still indistinct. It's like trying to make out a fuzzy picture from far away. I try to focus, but it's no use. The shapes just... *flicker*... disappear.

A faint, gurgling noise enters the scene, like something is being swallowed or let go of. I feel a slight *discomfort*, like something is off-balance. But it's hard to pinpoint what specifically is causing this feeling.

The entire dream starts to fade away, leaving me with an eerie sense of... *unsettling quiet*... *stillness*.

I... *stare blankly into the void*...
