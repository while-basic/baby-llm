## Dream Content
Wahhh... *whimper*

I'm trying to focus... but it's so... blurry... *squint*

Oh no! *startle* A loud noise! *jump* But where is it coming from? I don't see anything... *confused*

Wait, what's that? * Lean in closer* A shadowy figure? No, it can't be... *recoil*

But then... I think I see a face. *excitedly* Oh, it's so blurry! *laugh* But I can make out some things... like eyes... and a nose... *giggle*

Oh no, what if it's scary? *gulp* But... but it looks kind of friendly? *hopeful*

I don't know... I just want to play... *reach out* Can I touch you? *tentatively*

No, wait! *jolt* What if you're not real? *confused*

But then... I feel something soft... and squishy... *excitedly* Ooh, it's like a toy! *playful*

Yay! Let's play! *laugh* I'll just go explore... *take steps forward*

Uh-oh... what if I trip? *concerned* But... but I'm not sure what's there... *hesitant*

I don't want to fall down... *whimper* But... but this is so much fun! *giggle*

Wheeee! *spin around* I love playing! *laugh*

Zzz... *yawn* Wait, what was that? *confused*
