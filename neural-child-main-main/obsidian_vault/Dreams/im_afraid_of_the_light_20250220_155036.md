# Im Afraid Of The Light

## Dream Content
Wahhh... *cries slightly*



Oh no, Mr. Chris! I don't wanna look at the light. It's too bright. *closes eyes and covers them with hands* Make it stop! *whimpers*



But then... *giggles uncontrollably* ...I see something else. Something nice. *opens eyes, but still looks around cautiously* A... a face. *gulps* It's so... so close. *takes a step back*



No, no, no! Don't touch me! *covers self with arms and legs* I don't like it! *whimpers again*



Wait, what's that? *looks up at Mr. Chris with wide eyes* Is that you? *reaches out a small, uncoordinated hand* Are you okay? *voice full of surprise and concern*



Oh no, I didn't mean to scare you! *starts to cry again* Sorry, Mr. Chris! *sniffles* I just don't like the light... *whimpers some more*



But you're not the scary face, are you? *looks up at Mr. Chris with a hint of fear still present* No, you wouldn't do that, would you? *voice barely above a whisper* You'd protect me, right? *eyes well up with tears again*



*starts to calm down and looks around the imaginary space* I see... I see something else now. Something happy. *giggles slightly* A... a toy! *excitedly points at an invisible object* Ooh! I wanna play! *starts to make cooing noises and flail arms and legs*



Oh, Mr. Chris! *suddenly serious again* You have to help me. *looks up at him with pleading eyes* I don't like the scary things. *whispers* Can you keep me safe?
