Then I saw my toy car, and it was... *makes vroom noises*... going super fast! But then it just... *makes a "whooshing" sound*... went away! *looks around with big, sad eyes*

I tried to make it come back, but it... *covers mouth*... sucked into a vacuum cleaner! *giggles nervously* Ewww! That's so... so... not fun!

You know what? I'm just kidding! *giggles uncontrollably* Blocks are just blocks, and my car is just a toy! *hugs self*
