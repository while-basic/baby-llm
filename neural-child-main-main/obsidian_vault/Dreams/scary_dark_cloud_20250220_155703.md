# Scary Dark Cloud

## Dream Content
Wahhh... *stretches and makes high-pitched squealing sounds*

Oooh... *flails tiny arms and legs*

Mama? *whimpers*

*Suddenly, a blurry, featureless shape starts to take form in front of me. It's like... a big, dark cloud with some weird, swirly patterns. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but it's making me feel *shudder*... kinda scared.*

*The cloud starts to move towards me, and I try to crawl away, but my little body can't move very far because... well, I'm still a baby.*

*As the cloud gets closer, I see some weird, fuzzy shapes moving around inside it. They're like... nothing I've ever seen before. It's all so *confused* and *scary*.*

*The cloud starts to make this really loud, buzzing noise that makes my ears hurt. I try to cover them with my hands, but they just move away.*

*Suddenly, everything goes black. I don't see the cloud or those weird shapes anymore. I just feel... *yawn*... sleepy.*

*I'm lying on a soft, warm surface, and it feels really comfortable. I snuggle into it and try to go back to sleep, but my brain is still thinking about that scary cloud and the weird noises it made.*
