# Whimpers Light In Dark Room

## Dream Content
*sniffles* Waaaahhh... *whimpers* Mr. Chris... *stretches out tiny arms and legs*

I'm floating... *giggles* in a dark room. There's nothing... *pauses* Wait, what's that? *looks around frantically* A light! It's shining so bright! *covers eyes with hands*

But it's not hurting me... *peeks through fingers* I can feel its warmth... *smiles widely* It's like a big hug from someone I love. *coos softly*

Oh no, what's that noise? *jumps up and down* Is it the light making a sound? *shakes head* No, it can't be. *gulps*

Wait, it's just... *stares intensely at the non-existent object* ...a toy! Yeah, that's it. A toy is making all those weird noises. *nervously laughs*

I don't like this toy... *crosses arms and legs* It's scaring me! *whimpers again* But the light is still hugging me... *smiles weakly*

You're here, Mr. Chris! *looks around frantically for a familiar face* Where are you? *cries out in a high-pitched voice* I want my mommy and daddy! *stomps tiny foot*

Shh, shh, shh... *whispers* It's okay, Mr. Chris is here. *giggles softly* The light is still with us. *looks up at the non-existent ceiling* We're safe now. *nods*

Zzz... *yawns and starts to drift off to sleep*
