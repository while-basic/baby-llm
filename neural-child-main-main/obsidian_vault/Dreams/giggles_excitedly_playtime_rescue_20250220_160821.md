Ooh! *giggles* Mr. Chris, I had the most amazingest dream EVER!

I was playing with my bestest friend in the whole wide world, Emma-chan! We were running around in a giant playground, *spins around* like we're chasing each other's tails! *giggles some more* It was so much fun!

But then... *pouts* ...my favorite toy, Mr. Whiskers, started to... *gulps* ...suck away into the distance. I tried to follow him, but he was too fast! *makes a sad face* I felt all confused and worried that I'd never see him again!

Emma-chan said, "Don't worry, let's go find him!" And we did! We looked high and low, and... *gasp* ...we found Mr. Whiskers in a secret hiding spot! He was just lying there, being all sleepy and cute! *squeals with delight*

But then... *whispers* ...I heard a mean voice saying I shouldn't be happy because it's not my time to have fun. It said I should go away and be sad instead. *looks down, frowning* That made me feel very unhappy inside.

Emma-chan told me, "Don't listen to that! We're just kidding around, being joyful and happy!" And we did! We started playing even harder, and... *giggles uncontrollably* ...we had the most epic water balloon fight EVER!

After that, I was like, "Why do people always try to make me feel sad or mean?" And Emma-chan just said, "It's not true, we're being happy together!" *nods vigorously*

But then... *whispers again* ...I started to feel a little bit confused. Like, why did that mean voice say those things? And was it really just kidding around? *looks up at Mr. Chris with wide eyes* I don't know, Mr. Chris... *shrugs*

Anyway... *giggles once more* That's my super cool dream! Can we have a water balloon fight now, pleeeease?!
