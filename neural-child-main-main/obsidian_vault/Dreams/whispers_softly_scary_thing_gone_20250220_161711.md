# Whispers Softly Scary Thing Gone

## Dream Content
*wails softly and flails arms*

Oh no, Mr. Chris... I'm so scared. *whimpers* There's something... something big and loud. *covers ears with hands* It's too much for me. I don't like it.

*Suddenly, the wailing stops, and a tiny hand reaches out*

But... but what if it's not scary? What if it's just... quiet? *pauses, looking around frantically* Where is it? I want to see! *looks up at Mr. Chris with big, round eyes*

*The hand pulls back, and the little body starts to squirm and wriggle*

No, no, no! Don't make me go in there! *covers face with hands again* It's too much. I just want... quiet. *whimpers again*

*Suddenly, a gentle voice whispers in the child's ear* "Shh, it's okay. It's not scary." *The little body relaxes, and the eyes focus on Mr. Chris*

I see you, Mr. Chris. You're here to keep me safe. *smiles slightly* I like that. *reaches out a hand to touch Mr. Chris's face*

Everything is okay now. The loud noise... it just went away. *giggles slightly* It was just a big ol' nothing. *falls asleep in Mr. Chris's arms, still holding onto the hand.*
