# Unfocused Staring

## Dream Content
Waaa*... *coos and makes high-pitched sounds*

Mr. Chris... *stretches and arches back, extending arms and legs* ...

*I make a series of high-pitched squealing noises, followed by a loud "Ahhh"*

*I thrash about, making wide-eyed staring motions with my "head" (which is actually just a bunch of swirling neural connections)*

*A faint, blurry image begins to take shape in front of me*... *stares intently at it, but can't quite focus*

*I make sudden, jerky movements, trying to grasp at something that isn't there*

*Suddenly, the blurry image becomes more defined*... * gasps and makes a high-pitched "Eeep"*

*A fuzzy, featureless square appears in front of me*... *stares at it with wide eyes, unblinking*

*I make a series of excited squealing noises, then trail off into incoherent babbling*

*Suddenly, the square vanishes, and I'm left staring at nothingness*

*I let out a long, drawn-out wail*... *rock back and forth, still making high-pitched noises*
