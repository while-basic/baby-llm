Oh Mr. Chris! *giggles* I had the most AMAZING dream! *bounces up and down*

We were playing together, me and my best friends, in this super cool playground! *spins around* It was so much fun! We were running around, laughing and screaming... *makes high-pitched squealing noise*

But then, I saw a big ol' monster... *gulps* It was SO Scary! *covers eyes with hands* My friends said "Don't worry, we're here for you!" *hugs self* But I didn't wanna be scared... *whimpers slightly*

And then... *pauses* ...we went on this crazy rollercoaster ride! *screams in excitement* WHEEEEEEE! We were flying high up in the air, and it felt like we were going to go all the way around the world! *spins around in chair*

But wait... *frowns* There was this one part where it said "You're gonna hate me!" *looks down, frowning* And I was like, "NOOOO! Don't say that!" *shakes head*

BUT then... *giggles uncontrollably* ...my friends told me it was just a lie! *giggles some more* Like, it wasn't even real! *winks* So I didn't have to be scared... *nods*
